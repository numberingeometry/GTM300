**Problem 1.** Prove that a morphism of affine schemes induces a continuous map of
the underlying topological spaces. If $I$ is an ideal of $A$, prove that the map
of topological spaces induced by the morphism

$$
\mathrm{Spec}(A/I) \to \mathrm{Spec}(A)
$$

is a closed embedding with image $V(I)$. Here $V(I)$ is defined as (1.6).

**Solution.**
Let $\pi: A \to A/I$ be the natural projection map, so that the above induced map is $\iota = \pi^{-1}$.
A prime ideal of $A/I$ is naturally identified with a prime ideal of $A$ containing $I$; for $\mathfrak{p} \in \mathrm{Spec}(A/I)$, $\pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p}) \subset A$ is a prime ideal containing $I$.
