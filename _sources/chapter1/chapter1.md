**Exercise 1.1** Prove that a morphism of affine schemes induces a continuous map of
the underlying topological spaces. If $I$ is an ideal of $A$, prove that the map
of topological spaces induced by the morphism

$$
\mathrm{Spec}(A/I) \to \mathrm{Spec}(A)
$$

is a closed embedding with image $V(I)$. Here $V(I)$ is defined as (1.6).
